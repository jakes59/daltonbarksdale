        I have been a Lathrup Village resident since 2019. My wife and I moved here because we liked being close to everything, still in our own oasis, and most importantly, because of how great Lathrup Village is. I am running for City Council to do my best to make this great city even better.

        <br />
        As a father of a small child I want to represent the growing population of new parents and young professionals moving into Lathrup. I graduated from college with a double major in Math and Computer Science and currently work as an Engineer. I am great with numbers, budgets, and managing contracts.
